My project is to radomly generate a maze by dimensions (less than 10) provided by the user. It will use a grid by a 2d array, a stack for generating the maze path, and a tree for storing the vertices where there is a fork in the maze. After the maze is generated, the user can ask to solve it, which will run a DFS on the tree we created.
